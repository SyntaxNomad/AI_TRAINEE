# AI Chatbot Project Feedback

## Overview
This project implements a FastAPI-based AI chatbot that processes CSV data and answers questions about it using the Groq API with Llama model.

## Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with `main.py` handling API endpoints and `ai_engine.py` managing AI logic
- **FastAPI Implementation**: Modern async web framework with proper endpoint structure
- **CSV Processing**: Efficient handling of uploaded CSV files with proper parsing
- **Security**: Uses environment variables for API key management
- **Error Boundaries**: Implements boundary checking to ensure answers stay within data scope

## Code Quality Analysis

### Positive Aspects
1. **main.py:1-24**: Good separation of API logic with clear endpoint definitions
2. **ai_engine.py:16-25**: Robust CSV parsing with proper error handling using `decode("utf-8", "ignore")`
3. **ai_engine.py:31-34**: Well-structured prompt engineering with system message for boundary control

### Areas for Improvement

#### Critical Issues
1. **Security Vulnerability** (`ai_engine.py:10`): API key loading should include error handling for missing keys
2. **Memory Management** (`ai_engine.py:14,24`): Global variable `CSV_DATA` could cause memory issues with large files
3. **File Upload Validation** (`main.py:12-15`): No file size limits or type validation

#### Code Quality Issues
1. **Error Handling**: Missing try-catch blocks around API calls (`ai_engine.py:36`)
2. **Type Hints**: Inconsistent type annotations throughout the codebase
3. **Logging**: No logging implementation for debugging and monitoring
4. **Documentation**: Missing docstrings for main API endpoints

#### Dependencies
- Unused dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`faiss-cpu`, `sentence-transformers`)
- Missing essential dependencies like `python-multipart` for file uploads

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. Add file upload validation and size limits
2. Implement proper error handling for API calls
3. Add logging for better debugging
4. Remove unused dependencies

### Enhancements
1. Add data persistence options beyond global variables
2. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Add comprehensive unit tests
4. Consider streaming responses for large datasets

## Overall Assessment
**Score: 7/10**

A solid foundation for an AI chatbot with good architectural decisions. The code demonstrates understanding of modern web development practices but needs improvements in error handling, security, and production-readiness.
